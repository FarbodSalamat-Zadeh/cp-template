# cp-template

My bash script for generating C++ starter files for programming contests.

The C++ template includes some standard libraries, macros, and type definitions.

These can be customised by just modifying `template.cpp` according to your preferences.


## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to have a copy of the files on your machine.

You can run the script using:

```shell script
./contest <dir> <num>
``` 

where 
* `<dir>` is the directory you want to use for your starter files (it can be a new directory)
* `<num>` is the number of starter files you want to generate

_(To run the script from any directory, consider adding it to your `PATH`.)_
